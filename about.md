Hello, I'm Dave.

This is a blog I've only started recently (February 2018). It has two main purposes:

* to have a new space to blog about things I find interesting that don't fit into the usual stuff I write about on my other blog
* to have a play with Jekyll and GitHub Pages as an alternative to WordPress.

If you want to know more about me, why not look on LinkedIn?
